This file contains the data used by the KEYED-NOTES program.  The data in this file must take the
following convention.  The [] represent the type of data that must be found on that line.

block_name		[string]
offset_ins_lead_start	[real]
number_of_attributes	[integer]
attribute_prompt	[string]
attribute_prompt...	[string]

The block_name must be written exactly as the block is named and the block must be found within the 
search path of AutoCAD.

The offset_ins_lead_start is the distance, measured horizontall, from the insertion point of the block 
to the start of the leader measured at a 1:1 scale.  This number should read to 12 significant figures.  See
existing listings for examples.

The number of lines of attribute_prompts has to exactly match the number listed on the 
number_of_attributes line.  Do not include punctuation before or after an attribute_prompt.  Capatilize
the first word, but none of the others.  See existing listings for examples.

Lines can be skipped and spaces before and after (not in the middle of) a line are ignored.  
Tabs are also ignored before and after entries.
