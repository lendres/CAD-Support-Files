This program file was designed and written specifically for interupting the
daily grind of grunting AutoCAD drawings.  This is an AutoLISP and DCL version
of the classic logic game "Master Mind".


1) To use this or any AutoLISP file (*.lsp), you must first load the file.
   You can load this lisp file by typing at the command prompt:
      Command: (load "MastrMnd")


2) Master Mind
      Command: DP_MASTER_MIND

      Shorthand command is:
      Command: MM


3) The object of the game

   The master has chosen 4 of 8 different colors.  It is your challenge
   to correctly identify which 4 colors and in which position each color
   resides.

   Good luck.


4) How to Play

   When the MasterMind dialog is displayed, pick a color from the row of
   colored image tiles at the bottom.

   Then pick on an empty box in the first row.  Your color should fill the
   selected box.

   Make another color selection and repeat the process until you're satified
   with the row of colors you chosen.  Then pick the 'Guess' button.

   The master will then display smaller black and/or white pegs at the right
   of the user guess row.  Black pegs indicate the right color guess, but in
   the wrong position.  White pegs indicate the right choice in the correct
   position.

   Note: The position of the Black and White guess indication pegs, have NO
   bearing on the position of the user guesses.  There is no correlation
   between the position of a black or white peg and the position of a color
   choice.  The indication pegs only indicate that one or more color guesses
   was correct.

   You only get eight chance to beat the master.  If you can not guess
   correctly within eight, the master will display the hand.  You may at
   any time end the game by choosing the 'Reveal' button.

   Restart will clear the game and the master will pick a new set of colors.

   Because this is FREEWARE, there is no support for this funcion, so please
